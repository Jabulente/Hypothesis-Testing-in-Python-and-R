    "\n",
    "Effect size is a statistical measure that quantifies the strength or magnitude of a relationship or difference between variables, providing a standardized way to interpret results. Unlike **p-values**, which only indicate statistical significance, effect size reveals the practical importance of findings, making it an essential tool in research. Common measures include `Cohen's d` for comparing group means, `Pearson’s r` for assessing correlations, and `eta-squared (η²)` or `partial eta-squared (ηp²)` for variance explained in ANOVA. Effect size helps researchers understand the real-world implications of their results, guiding better decision-making and interpretation."

    "  - This indicates that only **0.5%** of the variance in `Yield` is explained by the type of **Irrigation** used. Since this value is less than 0.01, it suggests a very small effect and implies that irrigation type has a negligible effect on yield in this case.\n",
