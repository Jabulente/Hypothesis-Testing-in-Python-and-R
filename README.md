# Hypothesis Testing in Python and R

### **Overview**
This repository demonstrates the application of **hypothesis testing** using **Python** and **R**. It includes practical examples and real-world scenarios to analyze relationships between variables, test statistical assumptions, and derive insights. Whether you're a data scientist, researcher, or student, this repository will help you understand and apply hypothesis testing techniques effectively.

### **Key Features**
1. **Comprehensive Analysis**:
   - Conduct various hypothesis tests, including t-tests, ANOVA, and non-parametric tests.
   - Explore interactions between categorical and numerical variables.

2. **Python and R Integration**:
   - Scripts available in both Python and R for statistical analysis.
   - Comparative examples to highlight the strengths of each language.

3. **Automated Workflows**:
   - Automated testing for multiple numerical variables across groups.
   - Intuitive scripts for two-way ANOVA and regression analysis with interaction effects.

4. **Visualization**:
   - Graphical outputs for statistical tests, including boxplots, interaction plots, and residual diagnostics.
   - Easy-to-interpret visual summaries of results.

5. **Interpretation of Results**:
   - Detailed explanations of p-values, F-statistics, and effect sizes.
   - Insights into statistically significant differences and interactions.
